**Token Contract README**

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a standard ERC20 token with additional functionalities like minting, burning, and ownership management.

### Smart Contract Overview

The `Token` contract is an implementation of the ERC20 standard token with the following features:

- **Token Name and Symbol**: The token's name and symbol are specified during contract deployment.
- **Minting**: The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens and allocate them to specific addresses.
- **Burning**: Token holders can burn (destroy) their own tokens.
- **Transfers**: Tokens can be transferred between addresses.

### Prerequisites

To deploy and interact with this smart contract, you need:
- An Ethereum development environment such as Remix or Truffle.
- Basic knowledge of Solidity and smart contract development.

### Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the `Token` contract with a specified name and symbol. Ensure that the deployment address becomes the owner of the contract.

2. **Minting Tokens**: The owner can mint new tokens by calling the `mintTokens` function, specifying the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to mint.

3. **Burning Tokens**: Token holders can destroy their own tokens by calling the `burnTokens` function, specifying the amount of tokens to burn.

4. **Transferring Tokens**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses using the `transferTokens` function, specifying the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to transfer.
